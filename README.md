# EmbeddedMemoryDemo

Simulates memory-mapped I/O in a C environment for embedded systems practice.

## 👨‍🔧 Purpose

This demo mimics how a microcontroller might interact with peripheral registers using C structs and bitfields — common in embedded firmware development.

## 🔧 Build Instructions

### GCC / MSYS2:
```bash
gcc -Iinclude src/main.c -o build/embedded_demo.exe
./build/embedded_demo.exe
```

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- Bitfields in C
- Memory mapping simulation
- Embedded code structure
